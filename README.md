This app exists for all those individuals who would like to sell their goods in a more friendly environment. As users log into the MYM app, they can choose to buy/sell/browse local goods and services. After logging in, users can browse stores and products. They are then able to alert the seller of their desire to purchase the goods from the site via a built-in mailer. Users can review stores and leave feedback for other potential customers. As a maker creates a user as a seller they can; create a store, upload personalized images for their storefront, as well as their products! All users and sellers will be able to view and add calendar events so they can create community-driven events.

#### User Stories
 >Karen and Mike sell eggs and honey. They don't like facebook but it's the only way to the their neighbors know when new harvests are in. They would love an app that would allow them a little home to display their wares and respond to buyer inquiries.
 
 >Jane is laid off from her job due to Covid19. She bakes cakes and cookies and could sell them for extra money. She needs a platform to let people in her area know of her new goods and chat with her about orders. She would like to have a page of her own to show her unique style.
 
 >Megan has missed being able to sell her jewlery at local markets. Her hobby of making jewlry is an easy source of extra income, but she needs a place to sell her goods as they get lost in the bigger sites. She would like to stand out more than in a large nationwide store.
